# IST_3134-Final-Assignment-21041546
This is the Final Project for IST3134 Big Data Analysis, completed by Chan Pui Ying Joanna (21041546) and Gan Yi Jean (22041321). The project uses the MovieLens 32M, which provide millions of movie ratings for thousands of movies. 
The analysis is conducted using two approaches: a Hadoop MapReduce pipeline (via Hadoop Streaming on AWS EC2) and a non-MapReduce method using Apache Spark. The objective is to compare both methods in terms of implementation complexity, scalability, and output, while processing millions of movie ratings.
